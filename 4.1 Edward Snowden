  Edward Snowden's decision to leak top secret information about the National Security Administration security and surveillance practices, has an affect on the whole system rather than individuals and relationships because it helps to show that the structure of their system was generating behavior that in turn affected the system and so on until eventually someone, Edward Snowden, felt that it had become a wholey negative thing. It probably affected the whole of operations of those practices, because the relationship between the public and these top secret need to know people was tainted. If Edward Snowden had felt obligated not to leak the information, then it would probably have rewarded him for his adaptive behavior of reenforcing the system and the behavior it has generated in other people.
  Since Edward Snowden leaked the information he did, the government decided that no matter how ethical or not the decision was, that they needed to punish him for going against the system and the behaviors it find important to keep private. It showed the public that the whole organization was to blame, not any particular person, and as such would probably have affected the kind of behavior the system makes, but still would have cemented to them that even if Edward Snowden was right to have leaked the information, that overall the way the system was working and the way it should work is important to the safety of the people.
